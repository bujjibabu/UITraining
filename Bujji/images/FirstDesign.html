  <p>Originally a mail-order catalog in Easton, PA (Spencer Gifts), Spencer’s has become 
  the leader in fun and novel products from Lava Lights, humor, party and tees & 
  apparel to trend-right jewelry and accessories. In 1963 Spencer's expanded its reach 
  and opened its first store in the Cherry Hill Mall in Cherry Hill, New Jersey where we 
  continue to have a presence today.</p>

<div class="third">
 <p>From the outset, Spencer's quickly became an oasis within the mall environment 
 offering our guests an entertaining experience both through its merchandising and 
 product mix, and grew to a national chain by the mid-70’s. In 2003, under new 
 management, Spencer's lifted the bar higher and set out to reinvent itself. Remaining 
 true to its roots, the reinvention process remained focused on Spencer's strong
 history and commitment to irreverence, humor and fun. The result of this reinvention 
 set Spencer's on the path to greatness in a subtle shift from Spencer Gifts to 
 Spencer's in newly re-designed funky, industrial spaces with an award-winning
 downtown club look.</p>

 <p>In addition to the company’s retail presence, Spencer’s has taken the frontline in the 
 battle against cancer by fundraising on behalf of three organizations dealing with 
 cancer issues for young people under 40.  Since 2008, Boobies Make Me Smile has 
 collected almost $2mm to support organizations like the Young Survival Coalition,
 stupid cancer.org and Fxck Cancer – all which work toward prevention, education and 
 support of young people with cancer.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="fifth">
 <p>Today, Spencer's operates over 650 stores throughout the United States, Canada and
 online, and is proud to be one of the longest running shows in the mall. Strong
 operating disciplines combined with our unique merchandising formula underpins our
 continued growth.  We are committed to, and focused on, our core mission "Life's a 
 Party—We're Makin' it Fun!"</p>
