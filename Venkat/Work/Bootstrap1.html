Walmart is a family-owned business, as the company is controlled by the Walton family. Sam Walton's heirs own over 50 percent of Walmart through their holding company, Walton Enterprises, and through their individual holdings.It is also one of the world's most valuable companies by market value, and is also the largest grocery retailer in the U.S. In 2009, it generated 51 percent of its US$258 billion (equivalent to $284 billion in 2015) sales in the U.S. from its grocery business.While working in a local shoe factory, Walgreen accidentally cut off the top joint of his middle finger, ending his athletic competition.While working in a local shoe factory, Walgreen accidentally cut off the top joint of his middle finger, ending his athletic competition.While working in a local shoe factory, Walgreen accidentally cut off the top joint of his middle finger, ending his athletic competition.</div>

				<div class="col-sm-8">It would be impossible to tell the story of Walgreens drugstores without telling the story of Charles R. Walgreen, Sr. the man who started it all. Walgreen was born near Galesburg, Illinois, before his family relocated to Dixon, Illinois - a town 60 miles north of his birthplace - when his father, a farmer turned businessman, saw the great commercial potential of the Rock River Valley. It was here that Walgreen, at the age of 16, had his first experience working in a drugstore, though it was far from a positive one. Working at Horton's Drugstore (for $4 a week) was a job he took only because of an accident that left him unable to take part in sports. While working in a local shoe factory, Walgreen accidentally cut off the top joint of his middle finger, ending his athletic competition. Were it not for the accident, Walgreen might never have become a pharmacist, business owner and phenomenally successful entrepreneur. Ironically, his initial experience working at Horton's was itself a failure.Walgreen left after just a year and a half on the job.</div>

				<div class="col-sm-8">By every account, Walgreen succeeded brilliantly, simply by practicing what he preached and instituting what he felt were clearly needed innovations. New, bright lights were installed to create a cheerful, warm ambiance in the store. Each customer was personally greeted by Walgreen or his colleague, Arthur Thorsen. Aisles were widened, creating a spacious, airy, welcoming feeling - a far cry from the cramped interiors of other drugstores. The selection of merchandise was improved and broadened, including pots and pans(unheard of in a drugstore!) at the bargain price of 15Â¢ a piece! Prices were kept fair and reasonable. The quality of Walgreen's pharmaceutical compounds (he had become a registered pharmacist in 1897) met the very highest standards for purity and freshness. Efficiency was increased. But the most dramatic change Walgreen instituted was a level of service and personal attention unequaled by virtually any other pharmacy in Chicago. And this was exemplified by Walgreen's famous.Were it not for the accident, Walgreen might never have become a pharmacist, business owner and phenomenally successful entrepreneur.
