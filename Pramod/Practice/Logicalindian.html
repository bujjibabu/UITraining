				<p class=myform2>Remember the time when we were little kids? That was the time when we could not even button up our own shirt.Our mother used to get us ready then. She got us ready every single time.

				She prepared us for every problem we could ever face in our life. She made us what we are today, and helped us grow from irresponsible kids to impressive adults, holding our hand through every obstacle we faced.What our mother has done for us through all these years can never be repaid, but the least we can do is spare a moment and thank our mother for doing what she does best. Let?s thank our mother for getting us ready whenever we needed to be.</p>
